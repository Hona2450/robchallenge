      High school graduation was something that was very big for me because after 4 years of staying up long nights,
      stepping my grades up from previous years, and personal endeavors I got to the finish line of high school and
      got to start a new chapter of my life at UC Riverside.

      Orientation day was the beginning of my college experience and it meant a lot to me. 
      UCR made me feel welcomed to their campus and made me feel comfortable with the college
      that I decided on comitting to. I'm proud to be the first generation in my family to go
      to college in the US.

       I decided to try something new and worked at Mealtop Cafe to get a feel of how it is to
      be in the workforce and make some extra cash to have some savings in store for college. For the 
      first time I felt what it meant to put in long hours of labor into a job and made me even more so
      realize that it is not the type of life I want to live in the future.

      This picture captures me finishing the LA Marathon. 26 miles from Dodger Stadium to Santa Monica Beach.
      Although I was a teenager of 190 pounds that did not prepare much for this, I still managed to run this
      challenging run. I ran through the cramps, the soreness, and pain and perservered until the end. This was
      one of the biggest challenges that I managed to conquer in my life.

      My last year of playing volleyball was an experience that I will never forget. During this year I was at 
      my best and despite not having a coach to coach us my team and I made it to the semi-finals of CIF. We 
      weren't able to win it all but it was an incredible experience all in all.
