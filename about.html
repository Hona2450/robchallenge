              <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my website.</h1>

              <p>My name is Christian Barahona and I am a freshmen that goes to UC Riverside. I am currently in the
                 pre-business program at UC Riverside that consists of taking all of my pre-requisites and major
                 requirments so that I could apply to the business school. I'm planning on picking a concentration 
                 in Business Inforamtion Systems in order to explore the more tech aspects of business especially that
                 in this day and age tech is vastly improving.</p>

              <p> My plan after college is to work for a big tech company like Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon,
                  etc. That's the goal but even if I land at another not too known company or startup company, that 
                would be fine as well. I would eventually build up expereince so that when I actually go work at one
                of those big companies that I am prepared to work there. If a great idea for a product came to me 
                throughout this process and I had the funding and experience for it then I would pursue it and see
                where I land with it.</p>

              <p> I chose to do this fellowship this summer because I feel that it would give me experience in 
                    managing a team of individuals in a company and it will also give me a chance to give back
                    to TXT after everything that it has done for me. TXT led me to believe that I have the potential
                    to do anything as long as I am willing to put in the work for it and I want to give that mindset
                    to other young Hispanic and African American kids who need a change in mindset.
